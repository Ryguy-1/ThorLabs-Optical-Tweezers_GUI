# ThorLabs-Optical-Tweezers-GUI

## Functionality:
- Connect to Optical Tweezers using National Instruments NIDAQ Control software and drivers to gather data and analyze.
- Auto Calibration of ThorLabs Optical Tweezers Using Analyze Feature and Semi-Auto Gathering data from QPD readout.
- Generalizable data. Files saved are solely QPD readout vs Time. (QPD for ThorLabs Optical tweezers may not be power calibrated)

## Next Steps:

Completion of accurately fitting to lorentzian in order to calculate the corner frequency needs work. This is highly dependent on the starting
approximation. We believe it would be best to make this a user input, but we ran out of time to do so. This should be rather straight forward. Also
checking back over our math for the other power spectra calculations would be in order and of great use! Thanks to whoever picks this up!
